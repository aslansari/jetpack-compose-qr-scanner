# QR Scanner with Jetpack Compose and MLKit
Welcome to the QR Scanner repository, a production-ready application built with Jetpack Compose and the powerful MLKit library. This application allows you to scan QR codes and retrieve the information stored within them in a fast and reliable manner.

This repository is not just a proof of concept, but a fully functional and production-ready QR code scanner that you can use in your own projects. We have taken care to ensure that the code is well-organized, well-documented, and easy to understand, so you can easily integrate it into your own workflow.


## Features
- View the information contained in the QR code in a convenient and easy-to-read format, with a sleek and modern user interface built using Jetpack Compose
- Limited area for scanning (dimmed background for non functional areas)


## Why MLKit?
I chose to use MLKit for QR code scanning because of its superior performance and reliability compared to other libraries like Zxing. With MLKit, we can scan QR codes quickly and with a high level of accuracy, ensuring that you get the information you need every time.
